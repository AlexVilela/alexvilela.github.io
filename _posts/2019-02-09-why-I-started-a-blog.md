This blog exists to share simple solutions that will hopefully help others. It's here to pass on knowledge that I acquired over 15 years of software development.

I will write mostly about technology. While writing a blog was always something that I had a keen eye on I never made it happen. Deeply inside I think I was mostly afraid of something. It's difficult to put into words but what if the whole internet didn't like it? Over time I realised that was unrealistic thinking. 

I've always been grateful to all the posts I read around. People that took their free time to write some info on how they solved a problem that is exactly the same problem that I have to solve. To all of you, thank you.

In the end what pushed me over the fence was a tweet that went along these lines: 
- You find something hard that you don't know
- You then study a long time to learn how that something works
- Then you never write about it because surely "everyone knows about it"

I couldn't find that tweet again but I definitely relate to it.

So these writings are mostly to give back, to help other people achieve great things, to show the solution to problems that I've encountered along the way.

Here's to many more.
